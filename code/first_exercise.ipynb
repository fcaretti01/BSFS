    "C. Let’s go back to the original set-up: Your best estimate is that the true return generating capability of BCM will be 8% annualized returns with an annualized standard deviation of 4%.

    "    \n",
    "        a) Note: A drawdown is defined as the time between the fund peak $ PnL until it surpasses that previous peak $ PnL. For purposes of this calculation assume that the dollars invested in the fund remain constant (e.g. when you make money, the winnings are swept out of your account; when you lose money, the dollars are also replenished. So the dollars you are managing remain constant).\n",
    "    \n",
    "        b) Hint: There is no closed-form mathematical solution to this problem. You must do this by running a series of simulations (e.g. Monte Carlo simulations). It is up to you to decide how many “simulations” you need to run before you answer converges.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ii. Instead of irrevocably committing your money to them for a 5 year period, imagine it is for a 10 year period and the other assumptions of (i) (a) remain the same. Over that period of time, what is the probability that you will observe them having a 90 day drawdown? What is the probability they would have 120 day drawdown? What is your intuition of observing a 90 day down, if you shorten and/or lengthen the period of time you can irrevocably commit to BCM? Explain.\n",

As the investor in the BCM, you are trying to learn what the true Sharpe Ratio of Ms. Afelis’s team. You think the appropriate way to do this is through observing drawdowns – after all, if she is truly skilled she should lose you less money, that is have a lower probability of a drawdown. But how much lower?\n",

In the middle of the table is the probability of observing a day drown of that length or longer, given the SR at the top of the column."
