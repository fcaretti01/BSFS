# BSFS QUANT – FALL 2024 SCHEDULE

## Introduction
The BSFS Quantitative Finance program introduces essential topics in quantitative finance, focusing on both foundational theory and practical applications. Key areas include:

- **Market Efficiency**
- **Factor Models**
- **Strategy Development & Signal Extraction**
- **Portfolio Optimization**
- **Execution**

Our sessions begin with an overview of fundamental concepts like market efficiency and quantitative trading strategies. We then dive into hands-on applications of popular strategies, such as statistical arbitrage, factor models, and mean-variance optimization. We’ll primarily use Python for data analysis, leveraging libraries like `pandas`, `numpy`, and `statsmodels`. No advanced coding or statistical background is required—just a willingness to learn and engage.

## Schedule
Meetings are held bi-weekly on Saturdays, with each session dedicated to:

- Exploring critical quantitative finance concepts
- Reviewing progress on practical strategies
- Engaging in group discussions on relevant topics

Our focus will shift from a light theoretical introduction to hands-on experience, allowing members to apply what they learn directly to practical scenarios.
